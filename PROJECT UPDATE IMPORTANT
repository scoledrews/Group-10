Ok guys, so we decided that... since we are "researching" the effects of the AHA for the years 2013-2016, we should use a comparison 
between the states that passed the ACA opposed to states that didnt. It came to my attention that in the dataset, there were states 
that didnt pass it and I assume there should be a way to seperate the ones that did and didnt. Anyways I think that we should probably
restart the code (really just changing a few pieces in the code), seperating and inputing (mean, median, etc.) any missing values, and 
then creating visual graphs for each of them. We can then compare the two types of states (that did and did not pass the AHA) visually 
with "bar graphs" or/and "line graphs" and then finally, create a write up that reflects the main research question. I think that should 
be really it??? The current research should still be elligible in these changes so ill keep it as is.  

Lotier response - I agree; just keep in mind we still need at least 3 vizualisations for this data according to the rubric. I was about
to edit the Colab doc but whenever the data is restarted we can go from there, I'm down.
