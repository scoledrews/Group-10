Ok guys, so we decided that... since we are "researching" the effects of the AHA for the years 2013-2016, we should use a comparison between the states that passed the ACA opposed 
to states that didnt. It came to my attention that in the dataset, there were states that didnt pass it and I assume there should be a way to seperate the ones that did and didnt. 
Anyways I think that we should probably restart the code (really just changing a few pieces in the code), seperating and inputing (mean, median, etc.) any missing values, and then 
creating visual graphs for each of them. We can then compare the two types of states (that did and did not pass the AHA) visually with "bar graphs" or/and "line graphs" and then 
finally, create a write up that reflects the main research question. I think that should be really it??? Ill go ahead and update the research quesiton on the coding if that 
helps as well.
